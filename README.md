# Windows lm-sensors
A seamless approach to replicating the Linux lm-sensors experience on Windows using LibreHardwareMonitorLib.

## üöÄ Motivation
I have always appreciated the lm-sensors approach on Linux OS for fetching simple CPU and GPU temperature information. This project aims to replicate that functionality on Windows.

## Requirements
- Windows 10 or higher
- Administrator privileges (required due to app manifest requirements for accessing additional sensors)
- .NET 8

## üôè Acknowledgments
This project was made possible thanks to the efforts of the [LibreHardwareMonitor](https://github.com/LibreHardwareMonitor/LibreHardwareMonitor) team. You rock!
